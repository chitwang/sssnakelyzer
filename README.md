# Python to x86-64 Compiler

This repository contains a Python to x86-64 compiler developed as a semester project for the Compiler Design (CS335) course during the first semester of 2023-24, under the guidance of Professor Swarnendu Biswas.

## Team Members

## Project Overview
The project was divided into three milestones and one final presentation, each contributing to the overall functionality and efficiency of the compiler:

1. **Generating AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)** - Weightage: 10%
   - Task: Implementing a parser to generate the Abstract Syntax Tree from Python source code.
   - Evaluation: Achieved 100/100 marks.

2. **Three Address Code (3AC) with Stack Pointer Manipulations** - Weightage: 10%
   - Task: Translate AST into Three Address Code with proper handling of stack pointer manipulations.
   - Evaluation: Achieved 100/100 marks.

3. **3AC to x86-64 Generation** - Weightage: 12%
   - Task: Translate Three Address Code into x86-64 assembly language and run the generated assembly using gcc.
   - Evaluation: Achieved 100/100 marks.

4. **Final Demo and Presentation** - Weightage: 3%
   - Successfully demonstrated the functionality and performance of the compiler.
   - Evaluation: Achieved 3/3 marks.

Developing this compiler was a challenging yet rewarding journey. Countless hours of hard work and numerous sleepless nights were dedicated to achieving our goals. Despite the challenges, our perseverance and teamwork enabled us to excel in the project. Our team was one of the very few groups to score 100% marks in the project evaluation.

This batch is the last to undertake the Compiler Design (CS335) course as a Department Compulsory. We are proud to have successfully completed this course and contribute to its legacy.
