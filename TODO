    Long string literal? 
    string thik krni
    
Extra:
    dictionary
    f-string
    try..except..finally
    multi dimensional list

Doubt in semantics: 
    tupe_checked
    global ka offset
    supporting float in modulo ? 
 

    only int in (for i in range,,)  (currently, return type of range is int )
    do we have to check if assignable ? 
    <function>:int = 2 ? 
    check if variable in assign / augassign
    if global not already a global, static typing doesnt work there. So do we have to support like this ?
    
    line numbers 
    
    typecasting inside list as well ? 
    change check type arithmetic 
    call init from class name ??
    3AC for "for"
    confirm name resolution method from sir 
    self.a:int = 3 in a fn except init ?
    3AC for typecasting ? 
    empty list
    return type of init ?
