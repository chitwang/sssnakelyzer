    Long string literal? 
    string thik krni
    
Extra:
    dictionary
    f-string
    try..except..finally
    multi dimensional list

Doubt in semantics: 
    else with while and for ?
   
    tupe_checked
   
    global ka offset

 
    trailer plus : how much to do 
    add global functions for range, len and print

  


    support is ?
    supporting float in modulo ? 
    
    is, not in, in 
    only int in (for i in range,,)  (currently, return type of range is int )
    for 2 in 5 ?? 
    do we have to check if assignable ? 
    <function>:int = 2 ? 
    a = [b=c,1,2]
    check if variable in assign / augassign
    if global not already a global, static typing doesnt work there. So do we have to support like this ?
    exact usage of global
    a:int cannot use a before initializing it (is_initialized)
    how to get function name in set_trailer_type_compatibility ???

    can we assume def foo(a:int, a:int):  such erroneous case will not be there
