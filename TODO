TODO:
    complex number
    review correctness
    Long string literal? 
    string thik krni
    
Extra:
    dictionary
    f-string
    try..except..finally
    multi dimensional list

Doubt in semantics: 

   
    tupe_checked
   
    global ka offset

 
    add global functions for range, len and print
    supporting float in modulo ? 

    only int in (for i in range,,)  (currently, return type of range is int )
    do we have to check if assignable ? 
    <function>:int = 2 ? 
    check if variable in assign / augassign
    if global not already a global, static typing doesnt work there. So do we have to support like this ?
    
    line numbers 
    
    typecasting inside list as well ? 
    change check type arithmetic 
    string plus ?
    user defined print ?
    None is compatible with all ? 
    call init from class name ??
